@SONG: Let There Be More Light
  (Waters)

Far, far, far away - way
People heard him say - say
I will find a way - way
There will come a day - day
Something will be done.

Then at last the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race
And melted hearts

Now, now, now is the time - time
Time to be - be - be aware

Carter's father saw him there and
Knew the road revealed to him
The living soul of .....

Oh, my, something in my eye - eye
Something in the sky - sky
Waiting there for me

The outer rope rolls early back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes
Was Lucy in the sky

Oh - oh - did you ever know - know
Never ever will they
I cannot say

Something in his cosmic art
And glowing slightly from his toes
The psychic and the nations fly


@SONG: Remember a Day
  (Wright)

Remember a day before today
A day when you were young.
Free to play alone with time
Evening never came.
Sing a song that can't be sung
Without the morning's kiss
Queen - you shall be it if you wish
Look for your king





Why can't we play today
Why can't we stay that way

Climb your favorite apple tree
Try to catch the sun
Hide from your little brother's gun
Dream yourself away
Why can't we reach the sun
Why can't we blow the years away
Blow away
Blow away
Remember
Remember


@SONG: Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun
  (Waters)

Little by little the night turns around.
Counting the leaves which tremble and turn.
Lotus's lean on each other in union.
Over the hills where a swallow is resting.
Set the controls for the heart of the sun.

Over the mountain watching the watcher.
Breaking the darkness waking the grapevine.
Morning to birth is born into shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine.
Set the controls for the heart of the sun.
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun.


Who is the man who arrives at the wall?
Making the shape of his questions at asking.
Thinking the sun will fall in the evening.
Will he remember the lesson of giving?
Set the controls for the heart of the sun.
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun.


@SONG: Corporal Clegg
  (Waters)

Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg
He won it in the war, in 1944.
Corporal Clegg had a medal too
In orange, red, and blue
He found it in the zoo.
Dear, dear were they really sad for me?
Dear, dear will they really laugh at me?
Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him.
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin.
Corporal Clegg umbrella in the rain
He's never been the same
No one is to blame
Corporal Clegg recieved his medal in a dream





>From Her Majesty the queen
His boots were very clean.
Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin.

@SONG: See Saw
  (Wright)

Marigolds are very much in love, but he doesn't mind
Picking up his sister, he makes  his way  into the seas
     or land
All the way she smiles
She goes up while he goes down, down
Sits on a stick in the river
Laughter in his sleep
Sister's throwing stones, hoping for a hit
He doesn't know so then
She goes up while he goes down, down
Another time, another day
A brother's way to leave
Another time, another day

She'll be selling plastic flowers on a Sunday afternoon

Picking up weeds, she hasn't got the time to care
All can see he's not there
She grows up for another man, and he's down
Another time, another day
A brother's way to leave
Another time, another day
Another time, another day
A brother's way to leave


@SONG: Jugband Blues
  (Barrett)

It's awfully considerate of you to think of me here
And I'm much obliged to you for making it clear
That I'm not here.
And I never knew we could be so thick
And I never knew we could be so blue
And I'm grateful that you threw away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed in red
And I'm wondering who could be writing this song.






I don't care if the sun don't shine
And I don't care if nothing is mine
And I don't care if I'm nervous with you
I'll do my loving in the winter.

And the sea isn't green
And I love the queen
And what exactly is a dream
And what exactly is a joke.



Singles



@SONG: Arnold Layne
  (Barrett)

Arnold Layne had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine
On the wall hung a tall mirror
Distorted view, see through baby blue
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, takes two to know
Two to know, two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne

Now he's caught - a nasty sort of person.
They gave him time
Doors bang - chain gang - he hates it
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, takes two to know
Two to know, two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne, Arnold Layne

Don't do it again


@SONG: Candy and a Currant Bun
  (Barrett)

Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
Like that......

Oooh, don't talk to me
Please just fuck with me
Please you know I'm feeling frail

It's true, sun shining very bright
It's you, who I'm gonna love tonight
Ice cream, taste good in the afternoon
Ice cream, taste good if you eat it soon

Oooh, don't touch me child
Please you know you drive me wild
Please you know I'm feeling frail

Don't try another cat
Don't go where other you must know why
Very very very frail






Oh my, girl sitting in the sun
Go buy, candy and a currant bun
I like, to see you run
Like that......


@SONG: See Emily Play
  (Barrett)

Emily tries but misunderstands, ah ooh
She often inclined to borrow somebody's dreams till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may
See Emily play
Soon after dark Emily cries, ah ooh
Gazing through trees in sorrow hardly a sound till tomorrow
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may
See Emily play
Put on a gown that touches the ground, ah ooh
Float on a river forever and ever, Emily
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You'll lose your mind and play
Free games for may
See Emily play


@SONG: Apples and Oranges
  (Barrett)

Got a flip-top pack of cigarettes in her pocket
Feeling good at the top
Shopping in sharp shoes
Walking in the sunshine town feeling very cool
But the butchers and the bakers in the supermarket stores
Getting everything she wants from the supermarket stores
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

Cornering neatly she trips up sweetly
To meet the people
She's on time again
And then
I catch her by the eye then I stop and have to think
What a funny thing to do 'cause I'm feeling very pink
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges

I love she
She loves me
See you





See you

Thought you might to know
I'm the lorry driver man
She's on the run
Down by the river side
feeding ducks by the afternoon tide
(quack quack)
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges
Apples and oranges


@SONG: Paint Box
  (Wright)

Last night I had too much to drink
Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink
Drink - a - drink - a - drink - a - drink

What a way to spend that evening
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
But in the scene I should have been
Far away
Away - away - away - away - away
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do - I can't think what to say
She sees through anyway
Away - away - away - away - away

Out of the front door I go
Traffic's moving rather slow
Arriving late, there she waits
Looking very angry, as cross as she can be
Be - a - be - a - be - a - be - a - be
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget


@SONG: It Would Be So Nice
  (Wright)

It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet, sometime






Everybody wakes, and in the morning
Hot tea and can't stop yawning
Pass the butter please.
Have you ever read the Daily Standard?
Reading all about the plane that's landed
Upside down?

And no one knows what I did today
There can be no other way
But I would just like to say

It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime

Everybody cares about the weather
And everybody should know better
What a waste of time
Everybody lives beneath the ceiling
Living out a dream that sends them reeling
To a distant place

But no one knows what I did today
There can be no other way
But I would just like to say

It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
It would be so nice
To meet sometime


@SONG: Julia Dream
  (Waters)

Sunlight bright upon my pillow
Lighter than an eiderdown
Will she let the weeping willow
Wind his branches round
Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams
Every night I turn the light out





Waiting for the velvet bride
Will the scaly armadillo
Find me where I'm hiding
Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams
Will the misty master break me
Will the key unlock my mind
Will the following footsteps catch me
Am I really dying
Julia dream, dreamboat queen, queen of all my dreams


@SONG: Point Me at the Sky
  (Waters)

Hey, Eugene,
This is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say
That I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me
And hide with me, baby

Isn't it strange
How little we change
Isn't it sad we're insane
Playing the games that we know and in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands and ....

Pointing to the cosmic glider
@SONG: Pull this plastic glider higher
Light the fuse and stand right back

He cried 
This is my last goodbye."

Point me at the sky and tell it fly
Point me at the sky and tell it fly
Point me at the sky and tell it fly

And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in

People pressing on might say
It's something that I hate to say
I'm slipping down to eat the ground
A little refuge on my brain

Point me at the sky and tell it fly
Point me at the sky and tell it fly
Point me at the sky and tell it fly

And all we've got to say to you is goodbye
It's time to go, better run and get your bags, it's goodbye
Nobody cry, it's goodbye
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye......

@SONG: Scream Thy Last Scream
  (Barrett)

Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers
What'll be  to crunch in your sisters
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours

Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter
Flack chap chau fauses, mouses, houses
Flittin and hittin and fittin quack quack

Watching the teley till all hours big time
Fling your arms madly old lady with a daughter

Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket
Blam blam your pointers point your pointers
What'll be coming to crunch in your sisters
She'll be scrubbing bubbles on all fours

Scream thy last scream old woman with a casket


@SONG: Biding My Time
  (Waters)

Wasting my time,
Resting my mind
And I'll never pine
For the sad days and the bad days
When we was workin' from nine to five.
And if you don't mind
I'll spend my time
Here by the fire side
In the warm light of her eyes.
And if you don't mind
I'll spend my time
Here by the fire side
In the warm light of her eyes.


@SONG: Embryo
  (Waters)

All this love
Is all I am,
A ball is all I am.
I'm so new
Compared to you
And I am very small.
Warm glow,
Moon glow,





Always need a little more room.
Waiting here,
Seems like years,
Never see the light of day.

All around
I hear strange sounds
Come gurgling in my ear.
Red the light
And dark the night
I feel my dawn is near.
Warm glow,
Moon glow,
Always need a little more room.
Whisper low
Here I go,
I will see the sunshine show.

@SONG: Crumbling Land
  (Waters, Gilmour, Mason, Wright)

In a while I'll find the time to make the sunshine mine
In a smile I saw a single needle in the sky
Wheeling, soaring, gliding by

On a hill a little man with many shining things
Shiny pool, a shiny car and shiny diamond rings
Wining, dining, shining king

And the eagle flies in clear blue skys
Breathing in the clear blue air
Back here on the ground another dealer coughs and dies
And fifty more come rolling off
The Ford production line

Then a man appearing like up in our on the sand
In his hand a moving picture of the crumbling land
Screaming, scheming, movie man

Here we go, hold your nose and see if something blows
Close your eyes, count to ten and see the sunrise rise
Climbing, higher, to the sky

Climbing all the birds a lake the dove the lies
On the finger of the king
On high the eagle spies the glitter of a gun
And wheeling in a climbing turn he flies into the sun

Songs only in the Wall movie



@SONG: What Shall We Do Now?
  (Waters)

What shall we do to fill the empty spaces
Where waves of hunger roar?
Shall we set out across the sea of faces
In search of more and more applause?
Shall we buy a new guitar?
Shall we drive a more powerful car?
Shall we work straight through the night?
Shall we get into fights?
Leave the lights on?
Drop bombs?
Do tours of the east?
contract diseases?
Bury bones?
Break up homes?
Send flowers by phone?
Take to drink?
Go to shrinks?
Give up meat?
Rarely sleep?
Keep people as pets?
Train dogs?
Race rats?
Fill the attic with cash?
Bury treasure?
Store up leisure?
But never relax at all
With our backs to the wall.


@SONG: When the Tigers Broke Free
  (Waters)

It was just before dawn
One miserable morning in black 'forty four.
When the forward commander
Was told to sit tight
When he asked that his men be withdrawn.
And the Generals gave thanks
As the other ranks held back
The enemy tanks for a while.
And the Anzio bridgehead
Was held for the price
Of a few hundred ordinary lives.

And old King George
Sent Mother a note
When he heard that father was gone.
It was, I recall,
In the form of a scroll,





With gold leaf and all.
And I found it one day
In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away.
And my eyes still grow damp to remember
His Majesty signed
With his own rubber stamp.

It was dark all around.
There was frost in the ground
When the tigers broke free.
And no one survived
>From the Royal Fusiliers Company C.
They were all left behind,
Most of them dead,
The rest of them dying.
And that's how the High Command
Took my daddy from me.
