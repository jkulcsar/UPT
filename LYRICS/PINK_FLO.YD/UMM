@ALBUM: Ummagumma
Part 1 (Live versions of previously released songs)
@SONG: Astronomy Domine
 

Lime and limpid green a second scene a fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down the sound resounds around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn
Over, under, I ran, I ran to charm ya
Neptune titan stars can frighten

Blinding signs flat flicka flicka flicka blam pow
Stairway, scale down, dare whose lair

Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds the icy waters underground
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds the icy waters underground

@SONG: Careful With That Axe, Eugene
 

Careful with that axe, Eugene
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh   (repeat)

@SONG: Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun
 

   Little by little the night turns around
   Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
   Lotuses lean on each other in the early morn
   Under the leaves the swallow is resting

   Set the controls for the heart of the sun

   Over the mountain watching the watcher
   Breaking the darkness waking the grapevine
   One inch of love is one inch of shadow
   Love is the shadow that ripen's the wine

   Set the controls for the heart of the sun
   The heart of the sun(repeat)

   Witness the man who raves at the wall
   Making the shape of his question to heaven
   Whether the sun will fall in the evening
   Will he remember the lesson of giving

   Set the controls for the heart of the sun
   The heart of the sun(repeat)

Icy wind of night, be gome.
This is not your domain.
In the sky a bird was heard to cry.
Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied a deathly silence that lay all around.
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees,
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea.

In the lazy water meadow
I lay me down.
All around me,
Golden sunflakes settle on the ground,
Basking in the sunshine of a by gone afternoon,
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room.
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees,
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea.

In the lazy water meadow
I lay me down.
All around me,
Golden sunflakes covering the ground,
Basking in the sunshine of a by gone afternoon,
Bringing sounds of yesterday into my city room.
Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox gone to ground.
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water.
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees,
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer making for the sea.

Following the path as it leads towards the Darkness in the North
Weary strangers' faces show their sympathy
They've seen that hope before
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't touch the restless sky
Close your aching eyes beyond your name

Mist is swelling, creatures crawling,
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know the folly was your own
But the force behind can't conquer all your fears
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't touch the restless sky
Close your aching eyes beyond your name

Throw your thoughts back many years
To the time when there was life in every morning
Perhaps a day will come
When the nights will be as on that morning
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
Before you the night is beckoning
And you know you can't delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can't touch the restless sky
Close your aching eyes beyond your name

In P. Floyd, "Ummagumma", "Set the Controls ..." there are also some
mistakes and some parts where I believe the words to be different than
what is shown.  I am going mostly by the version on "Pink Floyd Live at
Pompeii" in which the words are much clearer than the album version(albeit
still a touch muddled in a place or two).
